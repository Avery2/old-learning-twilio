# Twilio Chat Bot

One of the first programs I wrote. Created in a repo for Twilio job application. Do not expect this code to run. The app uses an old version of Twilio to handle a patient waiting room chat bot.

ðŸ™‚ **Note to Twilio: I wrote this code long ago when I was first learning to code so it is not representative of my coding now.**
